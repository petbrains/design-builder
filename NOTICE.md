### Design Motion Principles (Kyle Zantos)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/kylezantos/design-motion-principles
- **License**: MIT
- **Contribution**: Per-designer motion audit framework with context-aware weighting (Emil Kowalski, Jakub Krehel, Jhey Tompkins perspectives), Motion Gap Analysis workflow for finding missing animations, enter/exit animation recipes, per-designer anti-pattern catalogs, audit report template with designer sections
- **Files**: references/web/motion/emil-kowalski.md, references/web/motion/jakub-krehel.md, references/web/motion/jhey-tompkins.md, references/web/motion/audit-checklist.md, references/web/motion/motion-gaps.md, references/web/motion/common-mistakes.md, references/web/motion/accessibility.md (expanded), references/web/motion/performance.md, references/web/motion/technical-principles.md, references/web/motion/output-format.md, routing additions in references/web/motion-design.md

Motion principles synthesize work from:
- **Emil Kowalski** — [emilkowal.ski](https://emilkowal.ski), [animations.dev](https://animations.dev), [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski), [Vaul](https://vaul.emilkowal.ski)
- **Jakub Krehel** — [jakub.kr](https://jakub.kr)
- **Jhey Tompkins** — [jhey.dev](https://jhey.dev), [@jh3yy](https://twitter.com/jh3yy)

### HyperFrames (HeyGen)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes
- **Contribution**: Library-level animation knowledge (GSAP, WAAPI, CSS, Anime.js, Lottie, Three.js, Tailwind v4 browser-runtime) and the HyperFrames composition + CLI workflow for short-video generation (HTML composition seeked frame-by-frame, FFmpeg encode, lint/inspect/preview/render commands, transcription, TTS).
- **Files**: `skills/motion/SKILL.md`, `skills/motion/references/web-animations/{gsap,waapi,css,anime,lottie,three}.md`, `skills/motion/references/video/{hyperframes,hyperframes-cli,tailwind-runtime}.md`. Adapted excerpts of the original skills, which remain vendored at `.agents/skills/` and tracked by `skills-lock.json`. Web-UI references strip the HyperFrames-specific seek/registration contract and keep the library knowledge; video-mode references keep the contract.

### Playwright CLI (Microsoft)
- **Package**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@playwright/cli (part of https://github.com/microsoft/playwright)
- **License**: Apache 2.0
- **Contribution**: Browser automation skill — page navigation, snapshots, screenshots, DOM/style inspection, network mocking, tracing, video recording, spec-driven test workflow. Used by `/design-builder:review` (auto-captures running web apps for the design-auditor's visual mode) and by `/design-builder:improve --restructure` (captures live `inspiration_pages.url` references to `design/.cache/inspiration/`).
- **Files**: `skills/playwright-cli/SKILL.md`, `skills/playwright-cli/references/{element-attributes,playwright-tests,request-mocking,running-code,session-management,spec-driven-testing,storage-state,test-generation,tracing,video-recording}.md`. Vendored from the standalone `playwright-cli` skill bundle. Runtime invocation goes through `npx @playwright/cli@latest` — no local checkout or global install required.

### Figma MCP Server Guide (Figma Inc.)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/figma/mcp-server-guide
- **License / Terms**: Figma Developer Terms (Beta). Rate limits apply: Starter / View / Collab seats are capped at 6 write tool calls per month; Dev / Full seats on Professional, Organization, or Enterprise plans follow per-minute limits (Tier 1 REST API parity). Code Connect features additionally require an Organization or Enterprise Figma plan.
- **Contribution**: Seven skills covering the Figma MCP workflow — Plugin API wrapper (`figma-use`), design-system build (`generate-library`), screen assembly (`generate-design`), Figma-to-code implementation (`implement-design`), blank file creation (`create-new-file`), project-level rule generation (`design-system-rules`), and Code Connect template authoring (`figma-code-connect`, excluded from this release). Plus the steering doc for batch Code Connect mapping via `send_code_connect_mappings`.
- **Files**: `skills/figma-use/` (top-level), `skills/design/references/figma/generate-library/`, `skills/design/references/figma/generate-design/`, `skills/design/references/figma/implement-design/`, `skills/design/references/figma/create-new-file/`, `skills/design/references/figma/design-system-rules/`, `skills/design/references/figma/code-connect-batch.md`
